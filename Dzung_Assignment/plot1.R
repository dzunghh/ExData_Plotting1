########## Data Science 4: Exploratory Data Analysis ##########################
###### This script is for Peer-graded Assignment Week 1 ########################

###Introduction
##This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, 
#a popular repository for machine learning datasets. 
#In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" 
#which I have made available on the course web site:
#Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
#Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with 
#a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. 
#Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.


###Loading the data

##When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:
#The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate 
#of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. 
#Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).

#We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. 
#One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than 
#reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.

#You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes 
#in R using the strptime() and as.Date() functions.

#Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

### Making Plots

#Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
#varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to
#reconstruct the plots that can be found [here](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1), all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

#For each plot you should

#- Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
#pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
#- Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.
#- Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
#constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
#the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
#the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
#include the code that creates the PNG file.
#- Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository
